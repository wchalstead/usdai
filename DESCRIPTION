Description: Typical asymptotic theory for hypothesis testing requires that our dimension d remains constant as the sample size n grows. usdai provides methods for conducting hypothesis tests about the mean and variance of high-dimension datasets in absence of this assumption, requiring no prior knowledge of the behavior of d as n goes to infinity.
