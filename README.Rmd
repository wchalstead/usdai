# usdai

<!-- badges: start -->

Typical asymptotic theory for hypothesis testing requires that our dimension $d$ remain constant as the sample size $n$ grows. `usdai` provides methods for conducting hypothesis tests about the mean and variance of high-dimension datasets in absence of this assumption, requiring no prior knowledge of the behavior of $d$ as $n$ goes to infinity.

This testing procedure is based on the self-normalized cross U-statistic--- see @wang2020hypothesis and @shao2015self for descriptions of the self-normalization process and  @kim2024dimension for description of the cross U-statistic--- whose asymptotic density is plotted in @lobato2001testing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of usdai from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wchalstead/usdai")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(usdai)
## basic example code
```
