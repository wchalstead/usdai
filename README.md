# usdai

Typical asymptotic theory for hypothesis testing requires that our
dimension $`d`$ remains constant as the sample size $`n`$ grows. `usdai`
provides methods for conducting hypothesis tests about the mean and
variance of high-dimension datasets in absence of this assumption,
requiring no prior knowledge of the behavior of $`d`$ as $`n`$ goes to
infinity.

## Installation

You can install the development version of usdai from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wchalstead/usdai")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(usdai)
## basic example code
```
